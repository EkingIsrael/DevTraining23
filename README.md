5. Add Flexbox properties to the .row class to create a responsive layout with wrapped elements.
6. Implement media queries to control the layout of columns and rows on different screen sizes.
7. Improve the box sizing by using relative units (e.g., rem) for dimensions, padding, and margins.
8. Add hover effects to the boxes to improve the user experience.
9. Improve the line-height and text alignment for the boxes.
10. Optimize the spacing between sections and improve the overall layout.
